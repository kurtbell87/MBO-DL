# AGENTS.md — MBO-DL Agent Coordination

## Current State (updated 2026-02-24)

- **Build:** Green.
- **Unit tests:** 1003/1004 pass (1 disabled, 1 skipped). TDD phases exited 0.
- **Integration tests:** 22 tests, excluded from default ctest (`--label-exclude integration`).
- **27+ phases complete** (10 engineering + 17 research). CNN line closed (Outcome D). GBT-only path forward.
- **Compute:** Local preferred for CPU-only experiments (<1GB). RunPod for GPU. EC2 spot for large data only.
- **Full-year dataset:** 1.16M bars, 251 days, 255MB Parquet, S3-backed.

| 1 | bar-construction | done | done | done | done |
| 2 | oracle-replay | done | done | done | done |

## Next Action

1. **XGBoost hyperparameter tuning** (P1): Grid search to close the 2pp win rate gap. Spec: `.kit/experiments/xgb-hyperparam-tuning.md`. Local compute.
2. **Label design sensitivity** (P1): Test wider target / narrower stop. Spec: `.kit/experiments/label-design-sensitivity.md`. Local compute.
3. **Regime-conditional trading** (P3): Q1-Q2 only strategy. Spec not yet created.

## Agent Roles

| Agent | Scope | Entry point |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Orchestrator | Sequences phases, reads state files only, never writes code | `CLAUDE.md` → `.kit/LAST_TOUCH.md` |
| TDD sub-agent | Executes red/green/refactor phases (C++ engineering) | `.kit/tdd.sh <phase> <spec>` |
| Research sub-agent | Executes survey/frame/run/read/log phases (experiments) | `.kit/experiment.sh <phase> <spec>` |
| Research Synthesist | Reads all results, produces `.kit/SYNTHESIS.md` with cross-experiment findings | `/synthesize` command or `.claude/prompts/synthesize.md` |
| Breadcrumb steward | Updates navigation docs before ship | This file, `CLAUDE.md`, `.kit/LAST_TOUCH.md` |

## Constraints

- Sub-agents own source/test files. Orchestrator never reads them.
- Trust exit codes: exit 0 = success, exit 1 = read capsule.
- Integration tests are labeled — never run in default ctest.
- Kit state files live in `.kit/`, not project root.
